# Uber-Trip-Analysis
Uber has been a major source of travel for people living in urban areas. Some people don’t have their vehicles while some don’t drive their vehicles intentionally because of their busy schedule. In this project, I will take you through Uber trips analysis using Python.

By analyzing Uber trips, we can draw many patterns like which day has the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour for Uber and many other patterns. The dataset I’m using here is based on Uber trips from New York, a city with a very complex transportation system with a large residential community.
